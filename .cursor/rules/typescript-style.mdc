# TypeScript Style Guide

- TypeScript 5.x strict mode enabled.
- Use `zod` for runtime schema validation (shared-types package).
- React 19 with Server Components (Next.js 15 App Router).
- Prefer `function` declarations for React components.
- Use `Tailwind CSS` for styling — no CSS modules or styled-components.
- State management: `zustand` for client state, `@tanstack/react-query` for server state.
- Real-time: WebSocket via native API or Socket.IO client.
- 3D rendering: Three.js r170+ with `@react-three/fiber` where applicable.
- All API calls go through `src/lib/api.ts` fetch wrapper.
- Use `pnpm` as package manager. Never use `npm` or `yarn`.
- Prefer named exports over default exports.
- File naming: `kebab-case` for files, `PascalCase` for components.
